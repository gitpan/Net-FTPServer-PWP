Net/FTPServer/PWP version 1.00
===================================

A derived class from Net::FTPServer that adds some required features
to allow quotas and RADIUS authentication.

This is useful for what we call PWP (Personal Web Pages). This is a
particular scenario where possibly millions of users share a pool of
"stateless" FTP servers that access filesystems where their personal
web pages are stored. In this scenario, it is impractical to assign a
unique user-id to each user for permission control. Also, the
authentication depends on an external AAA server, which in our case is
a RADIUS server.

This class provides an FTP server adapted to this environment.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

   Net::FTPServer
   NetAddr::IP 3.00 or newer
   Net::Radius 1.32 or newer

Additionally, you will need either a RADIUS server that can cope with
vendor-specific attributes (VSAs) or the willingness to make a few
changes to the enclosed code.
