Net/FTPServer/PWP version 1.00
===================================

A derived class from Net::FTPServer that adds some required features
to allow quotas and RADIUS authentication.

This is useful for what we call PWP (Personal Web Pages). This is a
particular scenario where possibly millions of users share a pool of
"stateless" FTP servers that access filesystems where their personal
web pages are stored. In this scenario, it is impractical to assign a
unique user-id to each user for permission control. Also, the
authentication depends on an external AAA server, which in our case is
a RADIUS server.

This class provides an FTP server adapted to this environment.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

   Net::FTPServer
   NetAddr::IP 3.00 or newer
   Net::Radius 1.32 or newer

Additionally, you will need either a RADIUS server that can cope with
vendor-specific attributes (VSAs) or the willingness to make a few
changes to the enclosed code.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

I have no control on the machanisms involved in the storage or
transport of this distribution. This means that I cannot guarantee
that the distribution you have in your hands is indeed, the same
distribution I packed and uploaded.

Along the distribution file, you should have a file with the extension
".asc". This contains a GPG "detached signature" that makes it
impossible for anybody to alter this distribution. If security is of
any concern to you, by all means verify the signature of this file and
contact the author if any discrepancy is detected.
