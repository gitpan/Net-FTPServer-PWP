=head1 NAME

Net::FTPServer::PWP::Server - The FTP server for PWP (personal web pages) service.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ftpd [-d] [-v] [-p port] [-s] [-S] [-V] [-C conf_file]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Net::FTPServer::PWP::Server> is a FTP server
personality. This personality implements a complete
FTP server with special functionalities in order to 
provide a PWP service implementation.

The features provided include:

=over

=item *

Directory quotas

=item *

Authentication using the RADIUS protocol

=item *

Configurable root directory

=back

=head2 CONFIGURATION

A few config file entries have been added, as described below:

=over

=item B<pwp root subdir>

If specified, tacks its contents to the root directory obtained
through RADIUS. This allows the contraining of the user to a part of
her home directory.

=item B<default pwp quota>

Defaults to C<-1> or unlimited. Is the number of octets allocated
by default to users.

=item B<pwp quota cache secs>

Controls how often the FTP server will invalidate its notion of the
current space consumption. This allows performance tuning. Use a
larger value where a small number of concurrent (same user) sessions
are expected. Use a smaller value in the oposite case. Finding out
what 'larger' and 'smaller' means is left as an excercise for the
reader.

A smaller value causes each FTP server to scan the whole user
directory more often (actually, every time the number of seconds
specified passes).

=item B<pwp quota exceeded message>

The message to return to the user when her quota is exceeded. Defaults
to B<This operation would exceed your quota>.

=item B<pwp quota file>

The name of the quota file to use. Defaults to C<.pwpquota>.

=item B<pwp max quota file age>

Maximum age in seconds that the quota file can have, before requiring
it to be rebuilt.

=item B<pwp max quota file lines>

Maximum amount of entries in the quota file before forcing it to be
rebuilt.

=item B<radius realm>

The realm used for authenticating users. Defaults to 'pwp'.

=item B<radius server>

RADIUS server (or comma separated list of servers) to send requests
to. It is an error to not specify at least, a RADIUS server.

=item B<radius port>

The port to direct the RADIUS request. Defaults to 1645.

=item B<radius secret>

The secret used to authenticate against the RADIUS server. Not
specifying it is an error.

=item B<radius dictionary>

The RADIUS dictionary file used to encode and decode the RADIUS
request. It defaults to C</usr/local/lib/pwp-dictionary>.

=item B<radius timeout>

The amount of time we will wait for an answer from a RADIUS
server. After this many seconds, the server is skipped and the next
one is tried.

=item B<pwp radius vendor id>

The vendor-id used in the Vendor-Specific Attributes sent and received
from the RADIUS server. The dafault is 582. The value specified here
must match the one used in your dictionary files.

=item $rv = $self->authentication_hook ($user, $pass, $user_is_anon)

Perform login authentication against a RADIUS server. We also take
this opportunity to insert our very own handler for the DELE
command. This is required to properly keep track of the disk usage of
the user. Our handler is called C<_DELE_command> and is documented
below.

We also hardcode the SITE QUOTA command to allow the user to check her
quota. This is done with C<_SITE_QUOTA_command>, documented
below. Note that this will conflict with locally defined handlers for
the SITE QUOTA command.

=item _DELE_command();

This is supposed to intercept C<Net::FTPServer::_DELE_command> before it
is called. What we do here, is to note the size of the
soon-to-be-deleted file and apply the change in the quota file if the
operation was succesful.

Note that this might be somewhat dangerous or un-portable as
traditionally, method names starting with C<_> mean internal things
that should not be messed from the outside. Yet it seems we do not have
a better solution to this issue.

The code contains a race condition: If two different sessions try to
delete the same file at the same time, probably both will think they
did and will attempt to reflect this in the quota file. There's a
chance for both of the updates to make it to the quota file, thus
over-reducing the user's space allocation. This will correct
automatically afterr either a few more operations or some time.
