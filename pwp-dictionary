# Sample dictionary entries
#
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This file is written in a format which is similar to the old Livingston
# RADIUS dictionary file. You must add the vendor specific attributes
# below to your RADIUS server, in order to authenticate users of the
# Net::FTPServer::PWP FTP server.
#
# luismunoz@cpan.org / mpicone@cantv.net
#

# $Id

#
# These attributes are required to encode the basic request and
# response. They should not be needed in your real RADIUS dictionary,
# as they probably are already there.
#
ATTRIBUTE	User-Name		1	string
ATTRIBUTE	User-Password		2	string

## VENDOR SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES
##

# Custom Net::FTPServer::PWP vendor specific attributes. These must
# be added to your real RADIUS dictionary. Note that we chosen 582
# as the vendor id for this implementation. If your local config
# clashes with this, you can use 'pwp radius vendor id' in the FTP
# config file to use a different id. Don't forget to change this in
# your dictionary too.

# This one allows the RADIUS server to tell the FTP server what the
# user's home directory is.

VENDORATTR	582	homedir		1	string

# This allows the FTP server to send the realm, with an ASCII NUL at the
# end. This will make life easier for some RADIUS servers.

VENDORATTR	582	realm		2	string

# This allows the client to specify where the home dir hierarchy is 
# mounted. You're most likely not going to need this.

VENDORATTR	582	homeroot	3	string

# This allows the client to specify the depth of the home dir hierarchy.
# Most likely, you won't need this.

VENDORATTR	582	hashdeep	4 	string

# This allows the specification of the quota for the user, in megabytes
# (as in 10E6).

VENDORATTR	582	quota		5	integer
