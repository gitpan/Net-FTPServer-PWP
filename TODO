This -*- indented-text -*- file lists interesting features or
additions that will eventually make it into this module.

- Automatically create the user's home directory if succesfully
  authenticated. Possibly moving in files from some template location.

- A way to insure that a RADIUS Access-Accept actually comes from
  our servers.

- A quota that controls how many files can be created by the
  user. This should be tracked in the same quota file we use today.
